  <p style="color:lightskyblue;"><b>My dogs name is <span style=color:lightskyblue><b>Cookie</b></span> she has black fur and a white patch of fur on her
    chest. Cookie is 1 year old she is very hyper and sweet. She does not like
    to eat her food and she is very picky. She only likes to eat chicken and
    treats. She is hurt on her paw a little bit cause she is alergic to grass
    and she licks her paws and we don't like it. She likes to eat her fur and
    skin when she is nervous. She also has a bad habit of eating food that we
    eat. She has another bad habit of picking up stuff that is on the ground
    and eating it, like socks. When I come home from school she loves to lick my
    face and ears. She loves the backyard until she relizes you left her out,
    she loves chasing squirlls and apparently killing baby rabits. She goes and
    grabs baby rabits and eats them and she gets the baby rabits from a hole we
    have in our backyard and baby rabits come threw the hole and thats how she
    gets them. She is super feisty.</b>
